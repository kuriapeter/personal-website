      <h2>Memorable Moments</h2>
      <p>I grew up in Nakuru County, Bahati, Murunyu. <br>i lived together with my family of 10 members. <br>My mother was very harsh accoording to thst time but now I can see her fruits for she has contributed alot upto where i am right now.</p>
      <p>Example: I remember there is a time she punished me after she had left and i was the one to look after my siblings by opted to go and play with friends.</p>

      <h2>Family Bonds</h2>
      <p>I was raised up in a household where my parents advocated for peace and caring for one another. <br> That has helped me for now I am able to interact with different people ,maintain peace and help and care for others when they are in need.</p>
